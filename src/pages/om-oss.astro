              <p class="about-story__paragraph">
                Alirio Omsorg was founded by father and son, Mirza and Haris. Mirza came to Sweden in the 1990s from Bosnia and has called Örebro his home ever since. He took care of his great-grandparents for many years, which created a deep understanding of how important it is to have care that feels safe and familiar.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story__paragraph">
                Like many families from the Balkans, we have noticed that language, culture and traditions play a big role in well-being, especially as one gets older. At the same time, we see that all people, regardless of origin, deserve care that feels personal and warm.
              </p>
              <p class="about-story__paragraph">
                Our vision: We dream that one day we can offer even more - perhaps a home for the elderly where different cultures can meet, where the flavors of the homeland are on the menu and where everyone feels at home. But it starts here, with you, in your home, with the care you need.
